          <h1>Here's a little bit about me...</h1>
          <p>
            I am a fourth year at <b>UC Berkeley</b> studying{" "}
            <b>Computer Science</b>! I am originally from{" "}
            <u>Seoul, South Korea</u>, but I've lived in multiple countries
            throughout my life â€” China, New Zealand, and now in <u>the US</u>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <b>self-motivated</b> and <b>proactive learner</b> who enjoys
            delving into the <u>passion for programming</u> through internships,
            contract work, personal projects, and coursework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I like <u>exploring cute cafes</u> and{" "}
            <u>trying their overpriced drinks</u>,{" "}
            <u>humming to catchy songs</u> (back in my k-pop era), and{" "}
            <u>playing various games</u> (nintendo switch, board games etc.)
            with my friends!
          </p>
