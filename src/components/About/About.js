          <p>
            I am a fourth year at <b>UC Berkeley</b> studying{" "}
            <b>Computer Science</b>! I am originally from{" "}
            <b>Seoul, South Korea</b>, but I've lived in multiple countries
            throughout my life â€” China, New Zealand, and now in <b>the US</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <b>self-motivated</b> and <b>proactive learner</b> who enjoys
            delving into the <b>passion for programming</b> through internships,
            contract work, personal projects, and coursework.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I like <b>exploring cute cafes</b> and{" "}
            <b>trying their overpriced drinks</b>,{" "}
            <b>humming to addicting songs</b> (back in my k-pop era), and{" "}
            <b>playing various games</b> (nintendo switch, board games etc.)
            with my friends!
